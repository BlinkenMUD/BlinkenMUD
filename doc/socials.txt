Each social consists of a name, and up to 8 different lines of text.
The following is the format of the entry in the socials.are file:

name 0 0
char_no_arg
others_no_arg
char_found
others_found
vict_found
char_not_found
char_auto
others_auto

The first line consists of the name of the social (the command the player 
enters), followed by two zeros (placeholders, not used)
	example 0 0

'char_no_arg' is the line of text displayed to the person doing the social
when they do not give a target.
        You look for someone to make an example of.

'others_no_arg' is the line of text displayed to everyone else in the room
when a player does not give a target.
        $n is looking for someone to make an example of.
** (see below for a list of the '$' variables) **

'char_found' is the line displayed to the player doing the social when they
did specify a target, and the target was found.
        You make an example of $N.

'others_found' is the line displayed to everyone in the room except for the
player doing the social, and the target of the social.
        $n makes an example of $N.

'vict_found' is the line displayed to the target of the social.
        $n makes an example of you!

'char_not_found' is the line displayed to the player doing the social when
they specify a target that cannot be found.
        There's no-one by that name here.

'char_auto' is the line displayed to the person doing the social when they
specify themselves as the target.
        You make an example of yourself.

'others_auto' is the line displayed to everyone else in the room when
a player specifies themself as the target.
        $n makes an example of $mself.

The list can be terminated early (ie: if there is no nead for anything
after the others_no_arg) using a pound (#) on a line by itself.

An empty line must contain a single dollar sign ($) on the line.
