====== Problem

Some other muds use ROOM_FLAGS that aren't used in this mud. These need to be removed to prevent unwanted room behaviour when implementing new features. 

====== Fix

Compile roomfix.c
--
$ gcc -o roomfix roomfix.c -std=gnu99 -Wall
--

Run it with
--
$ cat ./$AREAFILE ./room > $OUTFILE
