====== Problem

Some other muds use ROOM_FLAGS that aren't used in this mud. 
These need to be removed to prevent unwanted room behaviour 
when implementing new features. 

====== Fix

Compile roomfix.c
--
$ gcc -o roomfix roomfix.c -std=gnu99 -Wall
--

Run it with
--
$ cat ./$AREAFILE ./room > $OUTFILE


Here is a simple script that will fix all the rooms in the 
dorectory and save the fixed rooms with a .fix extention. 

# Roomfix Script

for f in *.are ; do 
    cat $f | ./roomfix >$f.fix 
done

# End Script

Save the abobe in a file called fix.sh ain the area folder 
be sure to 'chmod +x fix.sh' before running 
then just type './fix.sh'

after that move all you .are files to a backup folder and rename 
all your .are.fix files to .are. Thats it shoulld work fine.
