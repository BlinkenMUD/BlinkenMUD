 Changes for snippet "do_slay" since v1.0

 1.1 removed references in install.txt to a separate .c file, included
     instructions to cut into act_wiz.c instead.

     included "slay.hlp" instructions, to be pasted into ../area/help.hlp

     split single "slay.v1" file into "install.txt" and "slay.c"
