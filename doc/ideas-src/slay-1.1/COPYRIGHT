The following snippet was written by Gary McNickle (dharvest) for
Rom 2.4 specific MUDs and is released into the public domain. My thanks to
the originators of Diku, and Rom, as well as to all those others who have
released code for this mud base.  Goes to show that the freeware idea can
actually work. ;)  In any case, all I ask is that you credit this code
properly, and perhaps drop me a line letting me know it's being used.
