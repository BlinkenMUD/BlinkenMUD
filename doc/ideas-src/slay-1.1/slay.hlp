58 Slay~

  Syntax: slay (who) <option>

  Where the "option" is one of the predefined "slay types".  Your coder can
  set up new types for each person who has access to the slay command.  To
  set up a new type is fairly straight forward, there are three messages,
  one sent to you (as the one who used the slay command), one sent to the
  poor victim, and one sent to everyone else in the room.  There are a few
  variables you can set in your slay type, including your name, the
  victims name, the sex of each, things like 'him','her','his','hers',etc.
  The format for using these variables goes like this:

  (Keep in mind, that "ch" stands for the "character" who used the slay
  command, "arg2" is the victim, which I would think, is self-eplanatory)

    $n  Result is the name of 'ch'.  If 'ch' is not visible to the target
        character, result is the string 'someone'.

    $N  Result is the name of 'arg2' (considered as a victim).  If 'arg2'
        is not visible to the target character, result is the string
        'someone'.

    $e  Result is 'he', 'she', or 'it', depending on the sex of 'ch'.

    $E  Result is 'he', 'she', or 'it', depending on the sex of 'arg2'
        (considered as a victim).

    $m  Result is 'him', 'her', or 'it', depending on the sex of 'ch'.
    $M  Result is 'him', 'her', or 'it', depending on the sex of 'arg2'
        (considered as a victim).

    $s  Result is 'his', 'her', or 'its', depending on the sex of 'ch'.

    $S  Result is 'his', 'her', or 'its', depending on the sex of 'arg2'
        (considered as a victim).

   A few examples follow:

    Rand
    Rand's balefire
    Siezing Saidin, you blast $N with a bolt of blazing balefire!
    Your vision goes negative as $n's searing bolt of balefire anhilates you!
    $n's blast of balefire rips $N from the pattern!

    In the above example, "Rand" means that only the character known as
    "Rand" can use this slay type, or will even see it as an option.

    "Rand's balefire" is the name of the slay option itself. The "Keyword"
    that you would use on the command line. *note* You can abbreviate the
    keyword as long as it's unique, exampe: "slay jonas balefire" would
    slay the poor slob jonas, using "Rand's balefire" as the slay option.

    The next three lines, are the "TO_CHAR" (to you) "TO_VICTIM" and
    "TO_ROOM" messages, with variables, that get sent to the appropriate
    people.
