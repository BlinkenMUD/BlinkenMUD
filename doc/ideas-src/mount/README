These are the files to add horses to a Rom2.4b4 mud. The original code was
taken from the Eod code, by John Booth (?). There is a problem with
extract_char (handler.c) or nuke_pets (act_comm.c) I don't know how to fix it,
so if anybody knows, please let me know 8)

The problem is:
All the horse stuff is saved into the player file, but it doesn't extract the
horse when you log out. When you relog in the mud the horse is still there,
but now, the player is not the master, and it doesn't load the old mount from
the pfile.

Well, any suggestions would be appreciate :)
